Here's a **comprehensive and structured note** of everything you've done to implement your **regex parser and matcher**, from start to finish ‚Äî including design decisions and implementation choices.

## üß© **Regex Parser & Matcher ‚Äì Implementation Notes**

---

### ‚úÖ **1. Adding the Concatenation Operator**

**Problem**: Regular expressions like `ab` imply concatenation, but the actual operator is hidden.

**Solution**:

* Explicitly add a `.` operator between characters that are meant to be concatenated.
* You created a function to insert this concatenation operator based on specific rules:

  **Examples**:

  * `ab` ‚Üí `a.b`
  * `a(b|c)d` ‚Üí `a.(b|c).d`

**Handled Cases**:

* Implicit concatenation between:

  * Literal ‚Üí Literal / `(`
  * `*`, `+`, `?`, `)` ‚Üí Literal / `(`
  * `)` ‚Üí `(`

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Converting Infix to Postfix (Shunting Yard Algorithm)**

**Why**: Postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation) simplifies the parsing logic.

**Operators Supported**:

* `*`, `+`, `?`, `|`, `.`
* Parentheses `(`, `)` for grouping

**Precedence Rules**:

```
Highest:   * + ?
Medium:    .
Lowest:    |
```

**Steps**:

* Used a stack to temporarily store operators
* Output queue receives operands directly and operators based on precedence

**Examples**:

* Infix: `a.(b|c).d` ‚Üí Postfix: `abc|.d.`
* Infix: `a*.(b|c)+.d*` ‚Üí Postfix: `a*bc|+.d*.`

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Building the NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton)**

**Structure Used**:

* `Frag`: Represents an NFA fragment with:

  * `start`: Pointer to start state
  * `out`: List of outgoing arrows (dangling pointers)
* Used a stack of `Frag` while parsing postfix expression.

**For Each Token**:

* **Literal**: Create a state and a fragment
* **`*` / `+` / `?`**: Pop 1 fragment, build loop using epsilon (Œµ) transitions
* **`.`**: Pop 2 fragments, patch first to second
* **`|`**: Pop 2 fragments, build `Split` state to branch to both
* Final state is patched to a special `match` state.

---

### ‚úÖ **4. Matching the NFA using BFS**

**Key Challenge**: NFA allows multiple parallel paths (non-determinism)

**Solution**: Simulate NFA using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

**Details**:

* Defined a struct:

  ```go
  type element struct {
      stateId      int
      indexToMatch int
  }
  ```

* Used a queue to process `(stateId, indexToMatch)` pairs

* Maintained a `visited` map to avoid infinite loops

  * Especially for cases like `a*`, where same state can be visited repeatedly

**Visited Key**:

* `{stateId, indexToMatch}` ‚Äî if seen again, skip

**Handled Transitions**:

* **Epsilon transitions** (`Œµ`): Advance state without consuming input
* **Character match**: Advance state and increment index

---

### ‚úÖ **5. Adding Support for "Any Character" (Real Dot `.` Operator)**

**Problem**:

* The actual `.` (dot) in regex means ‚Äúmatch any single character‚Äù.
* You already use `.` internally as a **concatenation operator**.

**Solution**:

* Introduced a **new internal symbol**, e.g., `AnyChar`, to represent the real dot.
* While parsing:

  * Treat literal `.` as the any-character operator.
  * Still use internal `.` symbol for concatenation but not confuse the two.

**In Matching**:

* For `AnyChar`, accept any character at the current position.

---

### üß™ **Tests**

You wrote thorough unit tests:

* Basic literals and sequences
* Repetition (`*`, `+`, `?`)
* Alternation (`|`)
* Grouping and nesting
* Dot character and concatenation
* Corner cases like empty strings and overmatching
